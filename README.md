Infinite Scroll using ReactJS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

To load data from the Random User Generator we are going to use superagent.

For debouncing of the events (more on that in a bit), we’re going to use lodash:

To add superagent and lodash.debounce to your project via npm run:

### `$ npm install --save superagent lodash.debounce`

The crux of our infinite scroll component is going to be an onscroll event that will check to see if the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page. Upon reaching the bottom of the page, our event will attempt to load additional content.

When binding events, especially to scroll events, it’s good practice to debounce the events. Debouncing is when you only run a function once it a specified amount of time has passed since it was last called.

Debouncing improves performance for your user by limiting how often an event if fired and also helps take some strain off of any services you may be calling from the event handler.
